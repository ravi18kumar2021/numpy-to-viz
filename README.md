## 🔍 About

This repository is structured to help you **learn by doing**. It covers the core Python data science stack — starting with `NumPy`, progressing through `Pandas`, and ending with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for powerful visualizations.

Each folder contains curated example notebooks, practice problems, and real-world mini projects.
